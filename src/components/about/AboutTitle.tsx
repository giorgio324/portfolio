            I discovered my passion for web development when I began learning
            front-end development with React. However, as I delved into backend
            development with Laravel, I found myself truly captivated by it.
            Now, while I enjoy working with both, my enthusiasm for backend
            development has grown significantly. I&apos;m also eager to explore
            technologies beyond JavaScript and PHP to expand my knowladge.
